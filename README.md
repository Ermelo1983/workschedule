# README

My partner is working in a carehouse for elderly people.
Here they're working in shifts for day (full and half shift), evening and night.
During the week, they have a dayteam with 7 employees, in the evening 3 employees and during the night 1 employee for 1 department-floor.

She is working about 5 years at this company for now.
The company is an umbrella for multiple care houses, but all the houses are working with one or two planners, where it seems they all have troubles with a couple of things.
- busy for too long to get the workshift working
- when somebody is sick they have to fill the gaps, but where are the gaps and which employee doesnt meets all the workin hours, and which one has too many
- all the employees are asked 1 day where they never want to work, this is written down on a peace of paper, i want that in the shift never works on this day or day-part.
- generate a basis shift so you only have to move some off the shifts, and you dont have to it here for hours to create a shift.

So im trying to create something like that.
